File: debugger1.txt, where I talk about my use of a debugger for program 1

	Debuggers were very helpful for me on this assignment!  Most of my classes were very simple, and were implemented
	without any problems, but when I was working with my dungeon class (constructs the dungeon from an external file) 
	I ran in to a problem.  Reading each line from the file, and adding a new room where appropriate was working great.
	However, when I got to the last line in the file, the program would immediately segfault.  So I recompiled my program
	with the -g option, which places symbolic information into the executable generated.  

	After that, I ran that executable file through gdb, which at first wasn't super helpful because I just ran the program
	without telling gdb to stop anywhere to let me look at what was happening before the crash.  So then I set a breakpoint
	at my insert function, which is where the problem seemed to be, and ran it again.  When the program reached that function,
	execution paused, and I could then step through the program one line at a time to see exactly what was happening.  

	I the condition for the while loop I was using to go through the entire file was the problem.  It was not stopping where it
	should have, and it was trying to insert garbage in to my dungeon!  So I tried another approach, which would not do that
	and everything worked as I expected it to.
