File: debugger3.txt, where I talk about my use of a debugging tool for program 3

	For this program, I didn't have to use gdb to solve any problems with seg faults.  I was able to resolve all 
	of those just by drawing pictures to see what was happening this time.  I did however use valgrind to great 
	effect to resolve the lingering memory leaks I had from the first two assignments.

	I've decided whoever made the valgrind tool must be some kind of wizard, I was surprised at how easy it was to
	use it to find and fix all of the memory leaks I had.  I just had to use the tool with its full leak check 
	option, and it gave a report that told me exactly where I had used a new operator that wasn't cleaned up after
	the program was finished.  It sort of traces the function calls that lead up to the memory leak, and listed the
	files, functions, and line numbers where it happened.  I was able to quickly identify how to fix each one, whether
	it was simply forgetting to delete something I allocated in the application itself, or a destructor that wasn't
	written correctly.
