File: debugger2.txt, where I talk about my use of a debugger with program 2

	I did not end up having much success using a debugger to solve a problem I was having when working on this 
 	assignment, but I tried!  I had trouble implementing the data structure for this program.  I had successfully
 	implemented a binary search tree in CS163.  So I assumed plopping one in to this program would be really easy,
	however figuring out how to make the nodes function in the same way ended up being a challenge for me.  At first
	I only had set and get functions for the node, and when inserting nodes in to the tree only the first node would
	show up.  All the subsequent insertions would do nothing, and I was really unsure as to why, so I attempted to use
	gdb to watch for changes in a nodes left or right pointers.  From what I understand, you first need to set a break 
	point, and once that is reached, you can 'watch' a variable visible in the current scope.  But I couldn't quite
	work out how to get this to work the way I needed it to, and it didn't end up being helpful at all.

	I ended up looking at the code we used in the second lab, to see how Karla set up her nodes, and finally managed
	to work out how to get mine working.
	
	Also! I completely ran out of time, so I did not have a chance to solve the memory leaks from the first program.
	I do plan to make that a priority before finishing the third program though.
